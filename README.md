In this repository, I have created two files: "BMP280_With_I2C_Connection" and "BMP280_With_SPI_Connection."
Using the "BMP280_With_I2C_Connection" code file, you can retrieve data from the BMP280 sensor via an I2C connection.
Similarly, with the "BMP280_With_SPI_Connection" code file, you can retrieve data from the BMP280 sensor via an SPI connection.
